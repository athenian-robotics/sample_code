# Mecanum driving sample code

Simple mechanum drive sample code. In order to deploy to the robot, eclipse needs to be installed along with the FRC plugins as described [here](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/599679-installing-eclipse-c-java).

You also need to run the latest installer from [here](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources) in order to have the dependencies for CANTalons.
